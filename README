How to use the program:

  - build it with make
  - type the following command:
    ./quadtree  [-c compression_factor | -d | -m type] [in] [out]
    
    1. "-c compression_factor" is used for compressing a PPM file (compression_factor has to be a
    positive integer)
    2. "-d" decompresses the file
    3. "-m type" will mirror the file; the type can be "h" or "v" (horizontally or vertically)
    4. "in" and "out" are the input and output files
